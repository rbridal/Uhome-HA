# Uhome (U-Tec) Home Assistant Integration

A Home Assistant integration for U-Tec smart home devices via the Uhome API that allows you to control your locks, lights, switches, and sensors through Home Assistant.

## Device Types
- Supports multiple U-tec device types:
    - Locks
    - Lights
    - Switches
    - Smart Plugs (Wifi)

### Features
- Secure API communication
- Locking and unlocking
- Lock states
- Door states
- Battery levels
- Switch on and off (Lightbulbs use the switch capabilitiy for some reason, so at very least they should have rudimentary functionality)
- SwitchLevel (Honestly, idk what this is actually for, but hopefully we can use it to control light brightness until they properly implement light controls)
- Adaptive Aggressive lock confirmation when U-Tec push/webhooks are missing or late

## Adaptive Aggressive (locks)

U-Tec can register a webhook or cloudhook, but those push updates often never arrive. Without a workaround, Home Assistant only learns the new lock state on the next idle poll — 10–60 seconds late, or longer if you raised the interval to spare the API.

Adaptive Aggressive fills that gap **only after a lock or unlock command from Home Assistant**:

1. The command is sent as usual.
2. A one-device confirmation burst starts: poll at **1s, then 2s, 3s, 5s, 8s** (Fibonacci).
3. The burst stops as soon as the API reports the commanded state, a U-Tec push finally arrives, 5 attempts are used, or the next delay would be ≥ the idle poll interval.
4. Idle polling for every other device stays at the configured interval. Lights and switches are not burst-polled.

Each burst writes a diagnostic sensor (`Adaptive Aggressive`) on the lock:

| Value | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | A push cancelled the burst (webhook actually worked) |
| 1–5 | Polls until the commanded state was confirmed |
| 6 | Gave up (max attempts or next delay ≥ idle) |

### Recommended lock settings

Safest everyday setup when you care about the true bolt state:

- **Polling interval: 20 seconds.** Slow enough to be kind to the API, fast enough that a missed burst still heals. Adaptive Aggressive never schedules a delay ≥ this interval, so 20s still allows the full 1/2/3/5/8 sequence.
- **Optimistic updates for locks: off.** Home Assistant should show what the API confirmed, not what we hoped happened. Adaptive Aggressive is what makes that confirmation arrive quickly.
- **Adaptive Aggressive: on** (all locks, or the ones you operate from Home Assistant).

Configure those under **Settings → Devices & services → U-Tec → Configure**.

Passage mode is left alone: a lock already in Passage does not start a burst, because there is no commanded bolt state to confirm.

## Limitations
- Currently the Utec API doesn't support the following devices:
	- Wifi bridge modules
	- Air Portal registration / devices

## Requirements
- API Credentials
- External Access Configured (ie., Nabu Casa)

## Ensure Home Assistant knows its own URL
For the Configuration step below to work, Home Assistant must know its own URL.

Navigate to Settings > System > Network and set the Home Assistant URL (Normally `http://homeassistant.local:8123`)

## Getting Your Credentials
#### Having your credentials is necessary to configure the integration, so get them before you install it.

API credentials are now available directly in the Xthings Home app (formerly U-Home) version 3.5.5 or later. No need to submit a request through the developer portal.

1. Open the Xthings Home app and go to **My Account**
2. Tap **OpenAPI**
3. Follow the prompts to activate OpenAPI — select your role and the products you are integrating with, then tap **Activate Openapi**

![Steps to enable OpenAPI in the app](images/api_enable_steps.png)

Once activated, you will see your `Client ID`, `Client Secret`, `Scope`, and `RedirectUri`.
- Set `RedirectUri` to `https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/oauth` exactly as written — do not replace the hostname with your own Home Assistant URL
- Confirm `Scope` is set to `OpenAPI`
- Tap **Save**

For the integration you will need `Client ID` and `Client Secret`.

For more information, see the [Developer API Documentation](https://doc.api.u-tec.com/#intro). If you run into issues with the API, you can [submit a support request](https://developer.xthings.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).

## Installation
### HACS (Recommended)
Open HACS in your Home Assistant instance\
Click add custom repo\
Paste the URL of this repo and choose type integration\
Search for "U-tec"\
Click "Install"

### Manual Installation
Download the repository\
Copy the custom_components/Homeassistant-utec folder to your Home Assistant's custom_components directory\
Restart Home Assistant

## Configuration
In Home Assistant, go to Settings > Devices & services > Integrations\
Click the "+ Add integration" button\
Search for "U-Tec"\
You will need to provide the credentials information from above:
- Client ID
- Client Secret

When you submit, you will be taken to the U-Tec [OAuth site](https://oauth.u-tec.com/login/auth) where you need to login with your U-Tec username and password.  That will then ask you to authorize the OAuth connection.  After that it will take you back to Home Assistant and ask you to link your account to Home Assistant.

If the credentials are ever rotated by U-Tec or you regenerate them in the Xthings app, you can update them in place via the integration's **Reconfigure** action (3-dot menu on the integration card) — no need to remove and re-add the integration.

Lock-specific options (polling interval, optimistic updates, Adaptive Aggressive) are on the integration's **Configure** menu after setup.
