# Uhome (U-Tec) Home Assistant Integration

A Home Assistant integration for U-Tec smart home devices via the Uhome API that allows you to control your locks, lights, switches, and sensors through Home Assistant.

## Device Types
- Supports multiple U-tec device types:
    - Locks
    - Lights
    - Switches
    - Smart Plugs (Wifi)
 
### Features
- Secure API communication
- Locking and unlocking
- Lock states
- Door states
- Battery levels
- Switch on and off (Lightbulbs use the switch capabilitiy for some reason, so at very least they should have rudimentary functionality)
- SwitchLevel (Honestly, idk what this is actually for, but hopefully we can use it to control light brightness until they properly implement light controls)

## Limitations
- Currently the Utec API doesn't support the following devices:
	- Wifi bridge modules
	- Air Portal registration / devices

## Requirements
- API Credentials
- External Access Configured (ie., Nabu Casa)

## Ensure Home Assistant knows its own URL
For the Configuration step below to work, Home Assistant must know its own URL.

Navigate to Settings > System > Network and set the Home Assistant URL (Normally `http://homeassistant.local:8123`)

## Getting Your Credentials
#### Having your credentials is necessary to configure the integration, so get them before you install it.

API credentials are now available directly in the Xthings Home app (formerly U-Home) version 3.5.5 or later. No need to submit a request through the developer portal.

1. Open the Xthings Home app and go to **My Account**
2. Tap **OpenAPI**
3. Follow the prompts to activate OpenAPI — select your role and the products you are integrating with, then tap **Activate Openapi**

![Steps to enable OpenAPI in the app](images/api_enable_steps.png)

Once activated, you will see your `Client ID`, `Client Secret`, `Scope`, and `RedirectUri`.
- Set `RedirectUri` to `https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/oauth` exactly as written — do not replace the hostname with your own Home Assistant URL
- Confirm `Scope` is set to `OpenAPI`
- Tap **Save**

For the integration you will need `Client ID` and `Client Secret`.

For more information, see the [Developer API Documentation](https://doc.api.u-tec.com/#intro). If you run into issues with the API, you can [submit a support request](https://developer.xthings.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).

## Installation
### HACS (Recommended)
Open HACS in your Home Assistant instance\
Click add custom repo\
Paste the URL of this repo and choose type integration\
Search for "U-tec"\
Click "Install"

### Manual Installation
Download the repository\
Copy the custom_components/Homeassistant-utec folder to your Home Assistant's custom_components directory\
Restart Home Assistant

## Configuration
In Home Assistant, go to Settings > Devices & services > Integrations\
Click the "+ Add integration" button\
Search for "U-Tec"\
You will need to provide the credentials information from above:
- Client ID
- Client Secret

When you submit, you will be taken to the U-Tec [OAuth site](https://oauth.u-tec.com/login/auth) where you need to login with your U-Tec username and password.  That will then ask you to authorize the OAuth connection.  After that it will take you back to Home Assistant and ask you to link your account to Home Assistant.

If the credentials are ever rotated by U-Tec or you regenerate them in the Xthings app, you can update them in place via the integration's **Reconfigure** action (3-dot menu on the integration card) — no need to remove and re-add the integration.

## Configure options (UI)

After setup, open **Settings → Devices & services → U-Tec → Configure**. Changes apply without a full Home Assistant restart unless noted.

### Update Push Status
Enable/disable push state updates and optionally limit which devices receive them. Prefer Nabu Casa cloudhooks when Cloud is active. **Applied:** immediately (webhook register/unregister).

### Select Active Devices
Choose which discovered devices are exposed in Home Assistant.

### Configure Optimistic Updates
Control whether lock / light / switch commands optimistically update the UI before the device confirms. Can be all, none, or per-device.

### Polling Interval
How often Home Assistant polls the U-Tec API for device state (default 10 seconds). With reliable push/cloudhook you can raise this. Values from configuration.yaml apply only until a UI value is saved.

### Availability Threshold
How many **consecutive failed API polls** are required before entities are marked unavailable (1–5).

- **2** (default) — tolerate a single transient failure (matches the behaviour introduced in #61).
- **1** — fail fast on the first failed poll.
- **3–5** — more tolerance for flaky networks; a successful poll or push resets the counter. Devices that report offline are still unavailable.

Failed polls log a **warning** each time. When the threshold is reached, an **error** is logged. Auth failures mark entities unavailable immediately regardless of this setting.

**Applied:** immediately on the next poll.
